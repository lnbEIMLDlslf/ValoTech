# VALO Tech homepage

Static marketing homepage for **VALO Tech Pte. Ltd.** (Singapore), served as-is from GitHub Pages. No build step, no framework, no runtime dependencies.

VALO Tech is the parent of the **VALO ecosystem**. This page leads with **ValoLab** (a multi-agent AI workforce deployed on a client's own clean data, audit-defensible by design) and showcases the five ecosystem products: VALO Ads, VALO Pocket, Shimmra, Amavo, and **VALO Compliance**.

## Design language: "Lattice"

A teal-themed sibling of the VALO family languages (VALO Ads "Aurora", VALO Pocket "Verdant", Shimmra "Halo", Amavo "Ember"). It shares the family's chrome so all sites read as one ecosystem:

- **Token architecture** (CSS variables), brand teal `#0D5A54` sampled from the logo + jade accent, three-way **light / dark / system** theming.
- **Sticky blur header** with brand lockup, anchor nav, **20-language switcher**, a **3-way light/dark/auto** segmented toggle, and the primary CTA.
- **Ecosystem-strip footer** linking every VALO product (each keeps its own brand mark + color).
- **Custom teal scrollbar**, themed **SVG cursors + a cursor wake-ribbon**, scroll-reveal at `cubic-bezier(.16,1,.3,1)`, hover-lift + glow.
- **Animated brand logo** in the hero (circuit traces draw in, nodes pulse, data sparks converge, breathing glow, orbit ring).
- **Animated ecosystem hub** (VALO Tech at the center, products orbiting with flowing particles).
- Type: **IBM Plex Sans + Plex Mono** (self-hosted). Icons: **Phosphor** (inline sprite).
- Fully accessible: localized skip link + `aria-label`s, focus-visible rings, ARIA tabs, native `<details>` accordion, semantic landmarks; everything respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and is readable without JS.

## Internationalization

20 ecosystem locales (order, RTL, endonyms synced with the VALO standard):
SEA-priority `en zh zt vi th id ms tl` + Global `hi es ar fr bn pt ru ur de ja tr ko`.

- **English is the source of truth.** Every other locale is authored in full to a formal, natural register, with product names and technical terms (agent, cloud, audit, CRM, ERP, PoC, BI, markdown) kept in English.
- All 20 are authored in full: the page copy, the skip link, and the `aria-label`s on controls, regions, and diagrams are translated, applied by `site.js` via `data-i18n` / `data-i18n-html` / `data-i18n-aria`. Brand names and the small fixed-position labels inside the ValoStack SVG diagram stay in English by design (the circles are too tight to hold localized text).
- RTL (`ar`, `ur`) flips `dir`; the user's choice persists in `localStorage`, otherwise the browser language is matched.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push to GitHub (branch `main`).
2. **Settings -> Pages**: Source = *Deploy from a branch*, Branch = **main**, Folder = **/ (root)**, Save.
3. For the `valotech.org` custom domain: add it under Settings -> Pages -> Custom domain (creates a `CNAME`), then point DNS at GitHub Pages.

## Confirm before going live

- **Contact email** `hello@valotech.org` (every CTA + footer).
- **Production URL** `https://valotech.org/` (canonical, Open Graph, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, JSON-LD).
- **VALO Compliance** is shown as a new product with no outbound link yet (a "New" badge). Add its URL once the site is live.
- The four live products link to `valoads.io`, `valopocket.io`, `shimmra.live`, `amavo.app`. (To keep the whole ecosystem in sync, add a VALO Compliance card to the other four products' footer strips too.)
- Translations: all 20 locales are authored in full; to revise copy, edit the locale's block in `assets/i18n.js` (English first — it is the source).
